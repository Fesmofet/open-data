# Documentation standards

How we structure and maintain documentation in this repository.

## Document types

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `README.md` | Entry point + links |
| `developer-guide.md` | Run, setup, ops for developers |
| `architecture.md` / `overview.md` | Internal design and boundaries |
| `docs/spec/README.md` | Entry point for system spec |
| `overview.md` (under app spec) | What the app does — slim; links to feature specs |
| `<feature>.md` (under app spec) | One feature per file (e.g. `i18n.md`, `auth.md`) |
| `domain-model.md` | Entities and invariants (when added) |
| `use-cases.md` | Flows and behavior (when added) |
| `api-contracts.md` | External/system contracts (when added) |
| `states-and-transitions.md` | Lifecycle/state machines (when added) |
| `glossary.md` | Canonical terms (when added) |

## Writing rules

- One topic -> one canonical file.
- Use headings with stable names (never rename without updating cross-links).
- Cross-link instead of duplicating.
- Prefer explicit sections and tables over prose.
- Update docs when behavior changes (same PR).
- Mark unknowns and TODOs explicitly: `> **TODO:** description`.
- Do not describe generated Markdown under `generated/` as source of truth — code registries are.

## File size and splitting rules

- **`overview.md`** must stay slim: purpose, scope/stack, feature index table, verification commands. No feature detail.
- When a feature grows beyond a few paragraphs -> extract to its own `<feature>.md` under the same `spec/` folder.
- Add a row to the overview's "Feature specs" table when creating a new feature file.
- One file should cover one cohesive topic. If a file exceeds ~150 lines or covers two unrelated topics -> split.
- Prefer many small files over few large files.

## Principles

1. Small files.
2. Stable headings.
3. Predictable sections.
4. Explicit cross-links.
5. Minimal filler.
6. Canonical terminology.
7. Clear separation of **what**, **why**, and **how**.
8. Do not bury important constraints in prose.

## Page specs vs feature specs (web and similar frontends)

Use **two layers** under `docs/apps/<app>/spec/` so agents can rebuild UI from MCP search:

| Layer | Location | When to use |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **Page specs** | `pages/` | One **URL tree** (route area): layout shell, tabs, page-specific data loading |
| **Feature specs** | `spec/*.md` (root) | Cross-cutting behavior shared across pages (auth, SEO, feed, shared components) |
| **Component specs** | `components/` | Reusable UI not owned by a single route area |

**Page area layout:**

- `pages/index.md` — site map table (Route → hub spec → module).
- `pages/<area>/page-shell.md` or `page.md` — public URLs, App Router layouts, persistent regions.
- `pages/<area>/data-loading.md` — optional; server fetch / resolve for the shell.
- `pages/<area>/routes/<segment>.md` — one tab or child segment (even if code uses a single `page.tsx` + query).

**Do not** put route-specific docs only in the spec root (e.g. `discover.md` next to `auth.md`) when the area has a `pages/<area>/` hub — the hub is canonical.

**Frontmatter for pages:**

- Hub: `tags: [<app>, page, <area>]`; `related` includes `pages/index.md`.
- Route file: `related` includes the area hub + `pages/index.md`.
- On move: leave a **stub** at the old path (`status: deprecated`, `related` → canonical path, one-line pointer).

**Agent expectations (pages):**

- Adding a new top-level route → row in `pages/index.md` + hub or route spec under `pages/`.
- `overview.md` stays slim: link `pages/index.md` for routes; list cross-cutting features only.

## Spec file structure (recommended sections)

A typical feature spec file should use these sections (skip what does not apply):

1. **Title** — feature name.
2. **Back/Related links** — navigation.
3. **Purpose / normative goals** — what and why.
4. **Module layout** — code structure and layering.
5. **Behavior** — resolution logic, state transitions, data flow.
6. **Verification** — commands, test expectations.
7. **Architecture diagram** — mermaid when helpful.
8. **Related code paths** — table of files and roles.

## Frontmatter (YAML)

Indexed Markdown (`docs/**`, `docs/skills/**`, `tasks/lessons.md`, `**/AGENTS.md`) may include an optional YAML block at the top. Prefer explicit frontmatter for `tags` and `related`; when frontmatter is omitted, metadata is inferred from the file path at reindex time.

```yaml
---
id: docs-apps-chain-indexer-spec-hive-ingestion
title: Hive ingestion
type: spec
status: active
scope: chain-indexer
tags: [chain-indexer, hive-ingestion]
updated_at: 2026-06-10
related:
  - docs/apps/chain-indexer/spec/overview.md
---
```

**`id` convention:** slug from repo-relative path (lowercase, `/` → `-`), e.g. `docs/apps/chain-indexer/spec/hive-ingestion.md` → `docs-apps-chain-indexer-spec-hive-ingestion`. Omit `id` to use the same default at reindex time.

| Field | Required | Values / notes |
|-------|----------|----------------|
| `id` | no | Slug from relative path (see example above); used for MCP `get_file` and dedup |
| `title` | no | Defaults to first `#` heading or path slug |
| `description` | no | One-line purpose for agents (≤500 chars); shown in `list_files` / `get_file`; boosts FTS. If omitted, first body line after `#` title is used at reindex |
| `type` | no | `spec`, `skill`, `overview`, `adr`, `lesson`, `agents`, `registry` |
| `status` | no | `active` (default), `draft`, `deprecated` |
| `scope` | no | App name (`chain-indexer`, `web`, …) or `platform` |
| `tags` | no | String array for FTS boosts |
| `owner` | no | Team or individual |
| `updated_at` | no | ISO date |
| `related` | no | Paths to related docs |

**Path inference** (when frontmatter is empty):

| Path pattern | `type` | `scope` |
|--------------|--------|---------|
| `docs/README.md` | `overview` | `platform` |
| `docs/getting-started.md` | `overview` | `platform` |
| `docs/architecture/overview.md` | `overview` | `platform` |
| `docs/standards/docs-standards.md` | `spec` | `platform` |
| `docs/spec/*` | `spec` | `platform` |
| `docs/operations/*` | `spec` | `platform` |
| `docs/deployment/*` | `spec` | `platform` |
| `docs/apps/<app>/overview.md` | `overview` | `<app>` |
| `docs/apps/<app>/README.md` | `overview` | `<app>` |
| `docs/apps/<app>/developer-guide.md` | `spec` | `<app>` |
| `docs/apps/<app>/spec/overview.md` | `overview` | `<app>` |
| `docs/apps/<app>/spec/*` | `spec` | `<app>` |
| `docs/architecture/adr/*` | `adr` | `platform` |
| `docs/skills/*` | `skill` | `platform` |
| `tasks/lessons.md` | `lesson` | `platform` |
| `**/AGENTS.md` | `agents` | app or `platform` |

Reindex after doc changes: `pnpm knowledge:reindex` (local dev). Deployed **knowledge-api** picks up doc changes on pod restart (startup reindex, Redis-throttled ≤5 min on warm index). See [knowledge-api overview](../apps/knowledge-api/spec/overview.md).

## Skill files (`docs/skills/`)

Domain procedural playbooks for agents (Hive account creation, deploy runbooks, etc.). **Not** the same as `.agents/skills/` — that folder is Cursor runtime tooling (Next.js, Nx); `docs/skills/` is indexed by knowledge-api and searchable via MCP.

**Agent onboarding:** [`docs/skills/knowledge-api-routing.md`](../skills/knowledge-api-routing.md) is the canonical first-visit map. MCP server `instructions` duplicate a compressed version; keep routing skill and instructions aligned when adding tools or paths.

**CI:** `pnpm check:agent-docs` and `pnpm check:object-create-playbooks` (registry ↔ `docs/skills/object-create/*.md` one-to-one) run on relevant `docs/**` and registry changes in verify workflow.

Recommended sections (same spirit as feature specs):

1. **Title** — skill name (`# Create Hive account`).
2. **When to use** — triggers, prerequisites, when *not* to use.
3. **Steps** — ordered procedure; commands and payloads as fenced blocks.
4. **Verification** — how to confirm success (commands, expected output, rollback).
5. **Related** — links to specs, `AGENTS.md`, registry tools (`get_object_create_playbook`, `get_object_type`, …).

**Object-create playbooks:** every `OBJECT_TYPE_REGISTRY` key must have `docs/skills/object-create/{object_type}.md` with tag `object-create-playbook`. Template: [`docs/standards/templates/object-create-playbook.md`](../standards/templates/object-create-playbook.md).

Example:

```markdown
---
title: Create Hive account
description: Guide a user through creating a new Hive blockchain account.
type: skill
scope: platform
tags: [hive, account]
---

# Create Hive account

## When to use

User needs a new Hive account on mainnet; wallet/keychain available.

## Steps

1. …
2. …

## Verification

- `hive-js` / API returns account `alice`
```

Path inference sets `type: skill` when frontmatter is omitted. Add `tags` for better FTS ranking.

### Environment setup (two docs)

Do not mix these into one doc — agents search by intent and must land on the right target:

| Doc | Indexed path | Use when |
|-----|--------------|----------|
| [Setup agent workspace](../skills/setup-workspace.md) | `docs/skills/setup-workspace.md` | Sidecar agent without checkout; clone repo; resolve spec paths to source |
| [Getting started](../getting-started.md) | `docs/getting-started.md` | Local dev: Docker, migrations, `pnpm nx serve` |

Cross-link both ways in **When to use** / **When not to use**. Reindex after edits: `pnpm knowledge:reindex`.

## Agent expectations

- New docs should include frontmatter when metadata is not obvious from the path.
- New domain procedures belong in `docs/skills/` (not `.agents/skills/`).
- If you implement a feature and find no spec -> add a spec in `docs/spec/` or `docs/apps/<app>/spec/`.
- If a spec exists and code diverges -> update the spec or mark divergence: `> **TODO: spec-code divergence**`.
- If you regenerate reference docs from registries, treat the **code** as source of truth; generated output is illustrative.
- When adding a new feature spec for an app, create `docs/apps/<app>/spec/<feature>.md` and add a row to `docs/apps/<app>/spec/overview.md` "Feature specs" table.
- Keep `overview.md` slim — never put feature detail there; link to feature files instead.
- When changing behavior, update the corresponding doc in the same PR.
- Use relative Markdown links for cross-references; link to the canonical file, do not copy content.
