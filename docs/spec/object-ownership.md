# object_ownership

Content moderation edge with `ownership_type`: `exclusive` | `supervised`.

## Chain action

`object_ownership` — payload `{ object_id, method, ownership_type? }` (default `exclusive`). Account = posting auth.

Repeat **add** upserts `ownership_type` on PK `(object_id, account)`.

## Postgres

`object_ownership (object_id, account, ownership_type, event_seq, created_at)` — PK `(object_id, account)`.

## Validity (exclusive only)

Exclusive owners in set **E** (governance admins/trusted intersection, or full-mode union) gate updates:

- Different updates: VALID if creator ∈ E or any E member voted `for`.
- Same update: among E votes, highest `event_seq` wins (`for` → VALID, `against` → REJECTED).

**Supervised** rows are stored for UI; they do **not** affect validity in this release.

## Query API

- `GET /objects/:id/ownership?ownership_type=exclusive|supervised`
- Counts: `exclusive_count`, `supervised_count`
- Projection: `hasOwnershipAuthority`

## Migration

Legacy Mongo `authorities` body `ownership` → `object_ownership` with `ownership_type = exclusive`.
