export const QUERY_API_MCP_INSTRUCTIONS = `Read-only **live data** mirror of query-api (POST /query/mcp). Returns current platform state — not documentation.

This is **not** knowledge-api:
- Do not use search here to learn how features work.
- For specs and field semantics use knowledge-api (search_knowledge / resolve_doc) under docs/apps/query-api/spec/.
